# SudokuSolver

A simple sudoku solver and puzzle generator that uses a modified/slightly more efficient backtracking algorithm. Sudoku Solver is guaranteed to find solutions to any legitimate sudoku. 

**Current Features:**

* Solve (only one solution is found)
* Generate
* Save
* Load

**Future Features:**

*Statistical analysis of puzzles* - 
I think it would be interesting to figure out how many possible solutions there are given a puzzle.

Feel free to contribute to the project!
